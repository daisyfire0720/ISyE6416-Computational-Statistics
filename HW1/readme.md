Bisection algorithm in R ISyE6416 Computational statistics Homework 1

Write MATLAB code to implement bisection algorithm to find the alpha = 0:95-quantile of a t distribution with n = 5 degrees of freedom. Start with initial interval [1:291; 2:582]. Stop when the length of the interval is less than 10^-4.
